Linear Search is a search operation performed in a way that each and every element in 
the array or list is scanned one after another untill the element is found.

If element is not found it will return -1.

Here we will be creating a variable which will go through all the elements in the
array and verify every element with the value given by the user to find.

It is diffcult to use this method when we have many number of elements in our array.
Because it will check each and every element which will consume lot of time and resources 
of the system.
